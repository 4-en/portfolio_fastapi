# HELLO_WORLD

Change this content by editing static/pages/index.md
You can write using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

index.md content is displayed on the home page ("/" route), before the list of entries.
You can add other page files in the static/pages/ folder and link to them from here.
Routes for these files are automatically created based on the filename (e.g. static/pages/about.md is available at "/about").
You can add markdown (.md) or HTML (.html) files. Partial HTML files (without a <body> tag) will be wrapped in the site's template, while full HTML files will be served as-is.
